#### I'm a Full-Stack Developer working from India.

- 🌍 I'm mostly active within the **thenewboston** community.
- 🌱 Learning all about **Open Source**
- ✍ I write tech articles on **Dev.to**
- 🎓 I've studied computer science at BML Munjal University. I also explored machine learning, cyber security, and many other fields (I am very very curious).
- 💬 Ping me about `.html`, `.css`, `.js`, and `.py`.
